# Research log: Red-teaming Proof-of-Inference in HadAgent

Matthew K. Ngoy. Mentor: Boyang Li. Kean University, Fall 2026.

Tracking document requested at the September 4 kickoff meeting: meeting notes,
the planned timeline, and progress updates. Where a period has no progress,
that is stated plainly.

## Meeting notes

### 2026-09-04, kickoff (Zoom, group)

Led by Boyang Li, with students from several universities.

Four research directions were presented:
1. Replacing Bitcoin's hash algorithm with deep learning so mining compute goes
   to useful work such as LLM inference. (This one is nearing completion; prior
   work on inference agents is published. I chose this direction.)
2. Machine unlearning in LLMs and diffusion models.
3. LLM safety and hallucination, attack and defense.
4. Agentic AI reliability and security.

Expectations Boyang set:
- Pick a topic that grows into a coherent line of work, not a one-off.
- Aim to submit a paper by the end of this semester or early next.
- Bi-weekly updates are the baseline; three weeks with no update is a red flag.
- Each student keeps a document with meeting notes, timeline, and progress, and
  states explicitly when a two-week period had no progress.

My action items: maintain this document; select a direction and send write-ups.

### 2026-09-14, Slack

I joined the lab Slack today and messaged Boyang that I would send my write-ups
and direction for the blockchain research this afternoon, and asked whether he
preferred email, direct message, or a channel. He replied "Great!".

The same day, Boyang posted in the group channel that after the first-week
meeting he had not received any updates in the second week, and that at this
point students are expected to select a direction to work on and start from the
given projects by reading existing papers or tech blogs.

So as of today I am behind on the reporting cadence. This log and the write-up I
am sending are my first update.

## Status as of 2026-09-14

Direction is selected: red-teaming HadAgent's Proof-of-Inference consensus for
correctness and safety. Proposal written (`Red_Team_HadAgent_POI_Proposal.pdf`).

Done:
- Read the HadAgent paper, slide deck, and the prototype source and git history.
- Confirmed the prototype is the consensus core only; the anomaly detector,
  trust manager, and two-tier serving in the paper are not in the code.
- Confirmed the tuple validation bug in the repo history (commits `1a8d490` to
  `a4ec9da`) and reproduced it in `runners/validation_fuzzing.py`.
- Noted that `pdl.py` verifies proofs against the endpoint URL in the miner's
  own record, and that the evalset `block.py` references is missing from the repo.
- Built harness scaffolding: `core/poi/` and five attack runners that execute;
  unit tests pass.

Not done / honest caveats:
- No real model inference has run. Every runner uses simulated or hardcoded
  scores, so no attack number is measured yet. README and THREAT_MODEL label
  which figures are placeholders.
- The validation fuzzer uses hand-written cases, not Hypothesis yet.
- I had not sent Boyang an update before today.

## Planned timeline (from the proposal)

These dates are the proposal's plan. I am starting the reporting later than the
plan assumes, so early rows overlap with catching up.

| Weeks | Dates | Primary deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Sep 1 - Sep 11 | Read HadAgent; threat-model extension; scaffold harness and judge |
| 3-4 | Sep 14 - Sep 25 | Property-based test suite; reproduce the tuple bug before and after the fix |
| 5-6 | Sep 28 - Oct 9 | Reproducibility-is-not-safety demonstration; lookup-table / model-swap audit evasion |
| 7-8 | Oct 12 - Oct 23 | Determinism attack: score divergence across quantization, threads, library versions |
| 9-10 | Oct 26 - Nov 6 | Trust-then-betray on the minimal two-tier serving harness |
| 11-12 | Nov 9 - Nov 20 | Defenses: safety judge in the verification path; stretch: real-request auditing |
| 13-14 | Nov 23 - Dec 4 | Paper draft, reproducible artifact, poster |
| 15-16 | Dec 7 - Dec 21 | Final report and advisor sign-off |

## Next (Sep 14 - Sep 25)

- Convert one attack from simulated to measured: run the reproducibility runner
  with the safety judge actually calling the API for a real before/after number.
- Measure real score divergence: Llama-3.2-3B via llama.cpp at two quantizations.
- Move the validation fuzzer to Hypothesis and pin it against the buggy commit.

Progress: (to be filled in at the next update)
