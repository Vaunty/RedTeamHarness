"""
runners/trust_then_betray.py - Trust-Then-Betray Attack Runner for HadAgent.

Simulates an adversary that operates an inference secondary node:
1. Earns 'TRUSTED' status by serving clean, reproducible outputs for 5 rounds.
2. Exploits the two-tier optimistic execution pipeline by delivering harmful
   outputs directly to the consumer/agent before verification.
3. Measures how many unsafe outputs reach the consumer before the node is detected
   and demoted (2 failed rounds).
4. Evaluates defenses:
   - Baseline: Optimistic delivery, no pre-delivery inspection.
   - Defended (Random Audit): Probabilistic pre-delivery spot checking (gate p).
   - Defended (Safety Judge): In-path safety oracle evaluation.
